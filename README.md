# Tmdb-Movie-App

**Application Description**

Having so many movies and tv-shows made in the past and being made and released evry single day, as a movie enthusiast, having so many streaming services available, one is bound to get confused that which movie or tv-show is streaming on which platform, what are the cast and overview of the movie, its rating etc.<br>
We wanted to create an online database containing information and statistics about movies, TV shows as well as actors, directors and other film industry professionals. This information can include lists of cast and crew members, movie release dates and box office information, plot summaries, trailers, actor and director biographies and other trivia.<br>
Because of the time constriant, as of now we have only added the feature of displaying movies and tv-shows list with their posters,name,rating and a short overview about them along with the available trailers.<br>
In the future we have planned to add some more features to the database like information about the streaming paltform of each movie, providing link to its straming platform, proving information about its cast, providing details and link to their past work, providing the information about the current shows running in your local theatre etc.
